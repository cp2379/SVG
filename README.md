# SVG

This repository has all of my SVG files that I used for Assignment 2!

Here is the [link](http://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~cp2379/380/Assignment2/index.html) to my SVG Assignments Page!

I worked together with Lina Gamerman's project and forked her repository. This
is the [link](https://github.com/lg1986/svg) to her Github Repository.
